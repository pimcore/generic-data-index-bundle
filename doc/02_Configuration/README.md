# Configuration of the Generic Data Index Bundle

The Generic Data Index Bundle provides a generic way to index and search data in Pimcore. It is shipped with the OpenSearch client and provides a central configuration for it in order to be used in other bundles. 
This bundle can be extended and customized to fit your specific needs, for example if you would like to use a custom search engine.
